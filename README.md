## 📚 Library Management System (FastAPI + JSON CRUD)

A simple FastAPI project that performs **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations on a JSON file.

---

###  Features

-  **Add new records** (books)
-  **Read all data**
-  **Update existing records**
-  **Delete records**
-  Data is stored in a simple `data.json` file
-  Interactive Swagger UI for testing endpoints

---

###  Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** — modern Python web framework
- **Uvicorn** — ASGI server for running the app
- **JSON** — lightweight file-based storage

---

###  Installation & Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saadjassal/FastAPI-JSON-CRUD.git
   cd FastAPI-JSON-CRUD

###  How to Use (Swagger UI)

Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:
👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)**

There you can:

- `POST /books` → Add a new book
- `GET /books` → View all books
- `PUT /books/{id}` → Update a book
- `DELETE /books/{id}` → Delete a book

---

###  Example JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Atomic Habits",
    "author": "James Clear"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "The Alchemist",
    "author": "Paulo Coelho"
  }
]
```

---

### Example Workflow

1. Add a new book using the Swagger UI
2. View all books with `GET /books`
3. Update or delete using the book’s ID
4. All changes are saved to `data.json`
